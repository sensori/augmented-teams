Introduction to User Stories

What Are Stories and Why Do We Use Them?



================================================================================
SLIDE 4
================================================================================

As a result, industrial era organizations were built around the concepts of standardization, division, and control.

The results were the creation of wealth and employment at a hitherto unprecedented scale

At the turn of the last century, organizations were designed to get as many of the same type of goods to as much of the population as possible for the lowest possible cost.

Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black.

================================================================================

Commodity limited product selection to an undifferentiated mass of consumers

Cost focus, the lowest price point

Stable and low rate of change, similar products have been built many times before

Long lead times are acceptable

The focus of the last century was centralized planning driving down cost, consistency and repeatability

You can have any car you want as long as it’s black!

Today focus is speed, growth, innovation, and maximizing feedback in the face of increasing uncertainty

Success requires a First Mover or even True Innovator mindset

Order of Magnitude increase in change of products, plans, solutions etc.

Customer Learning is key

Focus is on Speed and Learning, cost is a secondary consideration

Today’s markets require a different approach to introducing products to our users

We need create value by working in smaller increments of scope that can be continuously delivered and validated

Big Project

Big projects and big releases are hard!

Lots of variability and unknowns!

Lots of dependencies!

Skyscraper 2 years

I need Shelter!

Cave – 5 Days

Increment 1

Increment 3

Tent - 2 weeks

House – 6 months

Increment 4

Skyscraper – 3 years

Efficiency takes a back seat to delivering smaller features to the market sooner!

Increment 2

Agile is all about breaking big projects into smaller units of work that can deliver business value

SLIDE 8
================================================================================

Stories are a semi formal narrative structure that help us describe solution functionality as small increments Of value

Good user stories are

a unit of scope

a unit of value/ behavior

a unit of planning

a unit of testing

a unit of story telling

Stories are an artifact that are owned and worked on by the entire team

================================================================================
SLIDE 9
================================================================================

Above all, Stories are action oriented, and they describe interactions between users and systems

Telling a good Story involves discussing how we want the system to behave in response to a user interaction

Manage User Accounts (User Goal)

Register New User Account ( User Activity)

Enter Contact Details (User Task)

It is hard to tell a good story by focusing on the delivery or development tasks required to build a system or on system internals

Build Registration Database

Research User Preferences

Design Contact Details Entry Form

Tip: Focus Stories on User Interactions and how the system behaves as observed by the users, document tasks and system internals using other artifacts

Story Flow For Delivery Teams



================================================================================
SLIDE 11
================================================================================

Tip: Avoid writing stories below sea level, i.e., a discrete user action and corresponding, observable system response

Stories are an approach that allow teams to focus on multiple levels of detail based on where they are in the discovery and delivery flow of work

Epics Business capabilities, end-to-end business processes, or end-to-end customer outcomes

Features  Concrete, smallish grouping of of business value that is natural to define, develop, and test at the same time

User Stories Captures a small increment of system behavior that a user can see

System Stories Captures a small increment of system behavior that crosses a system

Tasks Captures team work required to develop or test one or more stories, but

does not describe any system behavior

Market Increment

Story

Feature

Epic

Business capabilities, end-to-end business processes

Major objectives, and/or end-to-end customer outcomes

Contains 4 – 7 Features

Eg: Purchase Lottery Ticket

An integrated unit of scope that is easy to define, develop, and test together

Can be completed by a team within 1-2 sprints

Between 4 - 7 Stories

Eg: Purchase With Existing Card

A granular increment of testable and product verifiable work

Completed by a couple of team members in less than a week

5 – 9 Acceptance criteria or 3 – 5 testable scenarios

Eg: Display Players Existing Cards on Web

An increment of work that is deployed to real users in production

Teams should complete within 6 – 12 weeks

Eg: Purchase Lottery Ticket via Direct Pay with an Existing Card on Web

Tip: Size an increment of value so that it contains no more than 7-9 items of the next level of detail  (e.g. an Epic contains no more than 7-9 features)

When using stories, we break behavior down until we get to the story level and then group them according to a set of minimal viable increments



================================================================================
SLIDE 13
================================================================================

We are often handed an entire problem statement, a large boulder

We then progressively break that up into Epics and Features, our individual rocks

And then further define, deliver and test individual stories, our pebbles

We then aggregate those stories back into features, and increments and test and release them in a bundle

We call this approach the scatter-aggregate pattern

You do the work required to decompose something into a collection finer grained unit

You then work on each increment until you are ready to reassemble your work

Getting to the right level of detail can be thought of us progressively breaking up the boulders in our solution scope

Traditional delivery methods are based on the idea that distinct artifacts are create by people with discrete job titles

Project Managers work on project plans, product managers work on product strategies,  analysts work on requirements, developers write code and testers create and run test cases

This kind of approach doesn’t scale in the face of rapid market change and the need to deliver and learn in frequent small iterations

When teams work with the stories it is important that they learn to accept the idea that many people in the team will work on the same story

The product owner may identify it, the analyst may specify it, the tester may add additional edge cases and color it with examples, and the developer may code it. Or the team will evolve to an entirely different arrangement

In a nutshell Story Delivery is a team sport

Unlike traditional approaches story development is conducted by the entire team

Idea Shaping In A Nutshell



================================================================================
SLIDE 23
================================================================================

Goal: Co-create and socialize the key building blocks of an initiative (Customers, Problems, Features, Value, Cost, Effort) with all stake holders and participating people

Key Activities

Build a shared understanding of the goals, problems, and customer impacts

Evaluate Solution options

Estimate likely value drivers and cost drivers

Identify and explore critical assumptions

Story Writing Related Activities

Do just enough story mapping to …

Move from an abstract idea to concrete initiative

Understand the overarching scope of an initiative

Identify an initial list of increments that can be delivered to end users

Collaborate with engineering to provide an initial size estimate for each increment

Other Helpful Agile Artifacts

Opportunity Canvas

Uncertainty Kanban

Impact Map

Cost of Delay Estimation

Tip: In idea shaping you are working on an entire initiative; it is critical to avoid going to the lowest level of detail. Go wide and go shallow

The goal of Idea Shaping is to do just enough analysis to determine the over-arching parameters of an upcoming initiative

Ideas are introduced by working with Product Managers, as well as other OLG stakeholders, Lab priority etc

Product Managers, Product Owners, and the Lab Team Members agree on which labs can initiate shaping for an idea

Labs pull in an initiative when they have capacity and do just enough story mapping to identify a set of increments that can be released to production

Increments are added to the Kanban board and the lab collaborates with technology to size each increment

The Initiative ticket and related Increment tickets are moved to shaping done

Introducing Story Mapping



================================================================================
SLIDE 26
================================================================================

Teams can use Story Mapping to systematically decompose an initiative into smaller units of recognizable business value, known as stories. While the practice is highly collaborative, it also lends just enough structure to focus the conversation and accelerate understanding

Story Mapping is a highly collaborative practice that allow teams to iteratively identify and define the scope and priority of future state system behavior

Story Mapping is…

A lightweight and semi-formal approach to defining the intended behavior of a product

A story telling vehicle;  stories are arranged in a two-dimensional map resulting in a sequential narrative from left to right and a prioritization from top to bottom

A highly visible, highly sharable representation of end-to-end product scope

An accessible place where conversations are had to set and share context

A practice that intrinsically supports iterative delivery and product decomposition

Major categories of users that gain value from using the system

Major objectives that with tangible business outcomes and real business value.

Tangible, sequential events that describe what the user needs to do in order to get value

Small, concrete units of business value that are also the smallest increment of delivery, typically taking several business days to deliver

We prioritize stories by ordering them vertically on the map

The persona and story layer are the good / bits; the stuff in between is for context, the number of levels and labels will vary

Story Mapping is the practice of mapping user goals to business objectives and user actions down to tangible system behaviors

Exercise: Take a moderately complex initiative, and start to lay it out using a story map

Think hierarchically from your users to major business goals, user events, all the way to small & observable system behaviors

Start top-down or bottom up, whatever is easier to start

Move left-to-right or up-and-down; wherever your discussion takes you

Go beyond your external users and consider administrators, support people, operational users, power users, etc…

Think about all the required functionality, customer onboarding, product setup, onboarding

SLIDE 31
================================================================================

Like exploring a new body of land, we often start by understanding the boundaries of the thing we want to better understand

At any point we may uncover an entry point or other interesting detail

Exploration requires us to continually decide whether we continue to map the surrounding edges or to go inland and get a deeper understanding of internal terrain

In both cases mapping requires us to both document what we have discovered as well as extrapolate those findings to guess at the more complete picture

The metaphor of exploration and discovery is a powerful one, and is essential to successfully mapping out the relationship between user needs and potential solution features

When teams participate in Story Mapping, they are exploring the unknown terrain of future outcomes and corresponding system behavior

Tip: Complete only as much of the story map as you need to uncover uncertainty, validate assumptions and share understanding

Conduct a cursory scan to evaluate breadth and approach. Continue to rely on past experience to inform complexity

Guess the story complexity based on experience from similar work.

Deciding when to dive deeper, continue mapping at the current level, or to extrapolate and move on is as much art as it is science

================================================================================

A Minimum Viable Product is a mechanism to help you understand what customers actually need

Start with a minimum viable product

Get user, customer and market feedback

Deliver 80% of the value sooner

Continue to iterate based on feedback and learning

An MVP includes just enough valuable functionality to be released into the market

We want to get the product into the customers’ hands as soon as possible, measure their response and use that data to inform the choice of what we work on next

By taking this approach, we can become customer feedback driven and deliver value to customers frequently

An MVP allows you to test an idea by releasing a set of features (early in your product and/or service’s lifecycle) to targeted users and customers, in order to collect the relevant data, and to learn from it.

Delivering Minimum Viable Products Implies We Are Ready to Adopt Rapid Market Learning

Minimal Viable Product

Smallest increment that can enable us to learn whether we have a viable product for a highly uncertain market

Primarily defined as an increment of learning

Includes a formal hypothesis and how we are going to test that hypothesis

We test the market reaction of every increment we deploy and are ready to pivot to a new direction if required

If we are not ready to adopt rapid market learning, we may want to avoid MVP terminology

(Minimal Viable) Market Increment

A small increment of value that we (hopefully) introduce to the market and learn from

Primarily defined as an increment of scope

Less formal hypothesis, market testing, and expectations of pivoting based on market reaction

Critical to getting feedback from stake-holders and sponsors on whether we have built a solution that meets their expectations, known or otherwise

Delivering in small increment is a good first step towards higher quality delivery and accelerated market learning

During this course we will use the terminology of increments, and how to deliver them more frequently to our users

A Market Increment should be defined with the goal of realizing business benefits and/or validating key risks and assumptions



================================================================================
SLIDE 41
================================================================================

The following factors should be considered when prioritizing work into Markets Increments:

The business value of the Increment

The effort of developing the Increment

The amount of learning that will be gained

The amount of risk & uncertainty removed

The order of dependencies across your Increments

Defining Increments tends be a process that is started by Product Owner and Analysts but requires significant co-creation from technology and operations before it can be finished!

Prioritizing Market Increments needs to account for a combination of value, complexity, and risk

Prioritize according to a combination of business value, risk, effort, and uncertainty

Leverage the Splitting Patterns if stuck on how to split work into smaller increments

Make sure to define the purpose of each market increment, the value, and any risks you will validate, and learning achieved

Don’t forget to create increment tickets and link them to your Initiative ticket.

Discovery In A Nutshell



================================================================================
SLIDE 49
================================================================================

Goal: Align on the solution and scope of functionality in a way that fosters fine-grained and incremental learning and delivery of the next end to end slice of value

Key Activities

Key functionality & solution agreed to sufficient to make any hard to reverse decisions (platform, hardware, vendors etc)

Define a plan expressed as throughput, lead-time, and batch size across the delivery lifecycle required to deliver

Agree on the likely team composition and size required to deliver

Story Writing Related Activities

Scope, prioritize and schedule your next market increment of an initiative

Complete the Story Map for an increment identifying all required epics, features, and stories

Refine / split stories based on technical / platform concerns

Features are schedule and prioritize based on team(s) estimated throughput

Moving an Idea / Initiative through a Delivery Kanban

A Lab pulls in the next increment of value into discovery and completes the story map for that increment

As all the stories are identified for a feature, feature cards are created as children of the increment card and moved to discovery done.

Product, Analysts and Tech collaborate to ensure all features have accurate story counts

Once all features for an increment are complete the increment ticket is moved to done in priority order

Refining Marketable Increments of Value On Your Story Map



================================================================================
SLIDE 52
================================================================================

Avoid building all of one function and then building all of the next function and the function that, instead incrementally build an end to end product after every iteration

This does not mean that you will have a strictly complete product at the end of every increment rather you have some that  can achieve your user’s needs and goals

To do this you start by defining the spine of your solution, a simple, rough, even manual in solution in places, anything than can even remotely be considered optional is jettisoned

Rather than reports, you expose a database table, bare bones UI over fancy screens, validation is left out

If you ran out of money next week, what would you deliver next?

If all you had was time to deliver your spine, what would you deliver to support your business outcome?

When developing a product iteratively, start from the spine and then work your way outward

By dividing the entire Story Map into planned increments. We can visually tell a narrative for a particular increment.

We can also tell the story of how we want to order delivery to market.

Teams often build the story map iteratively, focusing on laying out stories for the next one or two increments at a time

As priority becomes clearer, you can revisit your market increments, placing the exact stories you want into your first and subsequent increment

Writing things down may be a required part of a knowledge worker’s job

But writing things down is far from sufficient

Written information is most effective when we add just enough structure to enable a focused conversation

Stories are semi structured artifacts that serve as a place holder to have an effective conversation

The exact amount of written detail behind a story will vary from team to team

Above all story must enable a semi structured narrative

Communication and collaboration is best accomplished when we use supporting artifacts to maximize the effectiveness of a personal, face to face dialogue

Planning, Scheduling and Forecasting



================================================================================
SLIDE 73
================================================================================

Stories are integral part of an agile team’s ability to plan, schedule and report on progress

At the beginning of every sprint teams estimate stories by assigning them a point value (1,2,3,5,8,etc) representing the complexity in a story

This complexity is relative to other stories in the team’s backlog

Estimating continues until a maximum amount of work that can accomplish in a sprint is reached

Tracking is accomplished by recording how many points worth of work was done inside a sprint, known as velocity to better plan in the future



================================================================================
SLIDE 74
================================================================================

Confidential

The Velocity and pointing approach to planning work is a good way to get teams to start collaborating in a way that increases a shared understanding of the work

Practices like sprint planning and story points are whole team activities

They are designed as activities that are done by the everyone on the team

These practices ensure that the team engage in a way that helps them challenge each other’s assumption

These practices encourage  team members to challenge each other’s understanding of the work that they need to

Most Agile Teams eventually hit a wall when it comes to planning their work using a sprint and story based approach

Extensive data collected in the field shows that pointing based estimations and tracking of  velocity is notoriously inaccurate and predictability rarely increases over time

In practice it is really hard to predict how much work is initiated and complete inside a small increment of time (eg a sprint)

The result is teams often end up padding their estimates to increase accuracy, or sacrifice accuracy to attain higher velocity

This practice is also deliberately team, development,  and sprint focused which ignores the bigger picture

The biggest source of delay and churn are often outside the team, happen outside the sprint, and are not directly due to the development team

Like Sands in an Hourglass So Goes The Stories In Our Teams Lives

In reality we can take what works with point + sprint planning, adjust to provide both a simpler and more holistic view

Small stories let us switch from estimating the details, which is both expensive, inaccurate and myopic, to simply counting them

We estimate the story count during shaping, and then plan progress by predicting how often stories across our flow of delivery

This works because, as long as most stories are small, we can treat all stories as being effectively the same size for planning and tracking  purpose, using the Law Of Large Numbers

Planning Is Made Simple By Calculating Throughput and Volume

A good metaphor for this kind of planning is asking how much time it would take to completely fill a bucket of water?

To calculate we an answer we simply need to understand how large the bucket of water is, and the rate the water being poured into the bucket, or the throughput

Estimating and planning is done by estimating the story volume of upcoming initiatives and their increments; then predicting what the throughput of the team is going to be and tracking what the throughput of the team has been over time

The Agile practice Of Relative Sizing is best conducted where size actually matters, Upstream and for larger buckets of Scope

Remember as part of Idea Shaping we want to do just enough story mapping to extrapolate how many epics, feature, and stories make up an increment

100 Stories

10 Stories

New Initiative

Already Delivered Initiative

At any point the work can be assessed by comparing and contrasting it to work previously completed.

As long work is similar from a platform and team perspective, than it is relatively easy to relatively size the new initiative against previously completed one

During Idea Shaping and Discovery we are continually identifying and refining our Marketable Increments

In either of these stages we can relate size our increments in the initiatives against each other as well as previously delivered increments of value that are similar in platform and team skills

Relative sizing at the initiative and increment level gives us an accelerated and surprisingly accurate estimate of size

Delivery

The reality is the biggest value of pointing is ensuring that the team only accepts stories that can be completed quickly, and that stories are small

Use sprint planning and story grooming (to be covered in later in training) as an opportunity to simply reject stories that are too ambiguous, or split work into smaller stories before accepting them

By only sizing enough work based on actual throughput they keep enough work to keep the team supplied as well creating predictable performance numbers

This approach scales across the entire delivery flow as we can see the volume of planned or actual work across all states in our kanban

Stories throughput is a simple and easy way for agile team’s ability to plan, schedule and report on progress

As soon as an Initiative / Increment is relatively sized we can place on one or more team’s backlogs based on priority order

As the delivery start date gets closer, work will also pass through the lab’s upstream flow and be continually broken up and story counts will be refined

Schedules are Estimated by placing work into Sprint Queues that are filled until an estimated Story capacity is reached

Inspect and Adapt is used to continually adjust backlogs based on Team Throughput

Exercise: Place relatively sized work onto one or more team's backlog

Finish relatively sizing your Initiative, Increments, or Features in your story map in terms of effort and complexity; guide the conversation by stack ranking them against other new items and/or previously delivered ones. Once relatively sized, we can infer a story count for each Initiative, Increment, or Feature.

Plot initiatives, increments, and/or Features according to when you think the team would be able to start delivery on them (Hint: think about the team's delivery throughput).

Bonus: Try write out a prediction of how stories will flow across our system of work. Think about the cadences we can use to help us plot movement of stories (e.g. planning, story testing, integration testing) to ensure we inject sufficient feedback into the system.

Describing Stories Through Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria describe the conditions that the story must meet to be accepted as complete by the Product Owner (who represents the user)

They are a way to share a clear boundary to the scope of a story, and help to describe to a team the conditions under which a story can be considered done

Are written in a behavior form or a more domain-oriented form

Acceptance Criteria

When the daily transaction cycle is complete then the system retrieves the all transactions for the last days Interac

When the system successfully retrieves the daily transactions from Interact then the system retrieves internal transactions from the internal transaction logs and the systems compares the two transaction records

When discrepancies are found then the system creates a report that contain entries for each discrepancy and alerts User ABC

Each discrepancy entry includes both transactions, as well as the discrepancy descriptor, a …

Reconcile Interact and Internal Payment Transaction File and Generate Discrepancy Report

As a BCAU operator, and an Interac Operator

I want to reconcile the Interac reconciliation file with the payment center transaction record and provide a list of discrepancies

This format came around in the early days of agile

In the absence of higher-level context, this format is useful to provide a reason for a system behavior to exist

The format can give the team insight into the mind of the end user, to hopefully help make better design decisions with the end user goal in mind

It also makes sure that each card represents a small change in the system's behavior

A short discussion on the Agile Story Format

Be wary of using the typical preconceived agile story template without understanding its purpose

TIP: If you find yourself writing a "story" that doesn't represent a small increment of system behavior in response to an end user action STOP and consider if the work is actually a story

HOWEVER

This format is frequently mis-used and attempted to be applied to work that does not require any of the above outcomes to be successful

With story maps in place, many teams find the typical template to be redundant and use a simple title to convey meaning

The main focus of the story should be the acceptance criteria, the story summary is only there to provide context!

Many agile teams use the:

As A              <User>

I Want To     <Perform Action>

So That        <I Receive Value>

Story Exploration In A Nutshell



================================================================================
SLIDE 99
================================================================================

Goal: Perform enough definition and design so that a small cross functional team collectively understands the what, the how, and the who of delivery for the next sprint (or maybe two)

Key Activities

The understanding of stories & their solution have been refined for a feature or thin slice

A subset of the team have taken ownership of delivering the work, estimated it, and committed to start in the next couple of days

Supporting design and definition activities are completed necessary to laying out how the stories will be delivered (e.g. UX, Domain Design, etc)

Story Writing Related Activities

Share a common understanding of the next feature/slide starting delivery

Define Acceptance Criteria for every story inside the next feature / slice to start

Refine / Merge/ Split stories as necessary to ensure they are expressed at a small / similar level of details

Remaining Key risks/ unknowns/ assumptions have been explored for upcoming to be delivered Stories

Other Helpful Agile Artifacts

Planning Game

Architecture Modeling

Spec By Example

Domain Driven Design

Tip: In Exploration you are going relatively deep on a smallest part of the solution that you believe a team can deliver on quickly together, but keep the focus of story writing on completeness from a user / system behavior

The goal of Story Exploration is to gain a deep share understanding of the outcomes and work required for the team to execute delivery activities together for a short period of time

Moving an Idea / Initiative through a Delivery Kanban

A Single feature is pulled into Exploration based on the Lab / dev team capacity

BAs collaborate closely with Product, Designers, and Tech to define and refine acceptance criteria for each story in the feature, including identifying and exploring assumptions and unknowns

Once done the feature is moved to Explore Done in The Kanban, and all stories in the feature are added to the Kanban as children of the feature; these stories are now considered ready for the team to start working on

Any athletes that run relay races will tell you it's not just about having the fastest runners; winning teams also focus on how well they pass the baton

Most work we find ourselves in is far more like a relay race than an individual sprint. We are constantly in demand from some other part of the organization, only to pass it to someone else

In relay races the receiving runner is already at full speed by the time they get the baton, the sender also ensures that the receiver doesn’t need to look behind him; the transition is seamless

In a relay race you optimize for success when you watch the baton; you don’t optimize for the individual performance of the runners, and it’s the same for our work as well!

Knowledge work succeeds by watching the baton, not the runner

Story

Feature

We pull Features, 1 -2 at a time

Test then release the next increment to production

Discovered

Feature Testing

Story Delivery

(Spec, Dev, Test)

Story Exploration

We spec, develop and test stories independently

We collectively define and design all of the stories in a feature

We validate features as soon as they are ready, and catch most of our defects early

Waiting To Release

We queue features until the increment is done

Tip: Size and resize features until each features represents a tightly integrated collection of stories that can be delivered in several weeks by a single team

We will increase in agility if we can frequently define, deliver, and test small incremental features on a frequent basis (a matter of weeks)

SLIDE 103
================================================================================

Many teams make the mistake of trying to figure out the detail of a particular story one at a time

But Stories do not exist in isolation, individual Stories are small segments of a larger, interlocking narrative

It is often easier to explore stories together,  grouping them in a way that allows us to discuss and deliver a more integrated set of functionality than a single story

While doing this we want to keep these groupings small, so we can incrementally deliver our work and maximize feedback

Focus Exploration on telling a more detailed narrative that spans a small grouping of stories

Session Overview

Sessions are often facilitated by Product Owner or Analysts, and actively attended by relevant SMEs, and the Development / Delivery people likely to build the feature

It is recommended to pick a highly visual collaboration tool. Like physical post-its if possible or Miro if remote so that everyone can participate

Try to keep sessions under an hour to keep minds sharp

Remember not every section of the story map must be explored all at once, incorporate into your process after story mapping and execute on a pull basis

Pitfalls to Watch Out For

Analysis Paralysis - Unknowns that require input from those not present should not derail the session. Rather, capture the assumptions and validate with SMEs afterward. It’s OK to have unknowns, the point of the exercise is to surface them, judge whether they are showstoppers, and balance acceptance criteria across stories

Siloed Sessions - Performing exploration sessions without key members of the team will inevitably cause churn. Missing technical team representation will make it challenging to load balance stories. Missing SMEs will make it challenging to answer questions that have major impact on story composition

Micro Stories - Militantly breaking down stories to the point of 1 acceptance criterion per story.  Breaking down work into task lists. Too much fragmentation can make it difficult to have the pieces fit together. Try to find a balance between small and valuable

The outcome of good story exploration session is a semi structured narrative that focuses on user and system behavior; it can be had for some teams to start there

Just as often we will want to jot down any information, we can get that we think would be relevant to the story or feature at hand

We are in effect mind mapping all the permutations of data, business rules, user actions, system constraints, etc that are useful to the discussion at hand.

Often we will need to just make sense of all the possible details and permutations associated with a particular grouping of stories

Exercise: Brainstorm Acceptance Criteria (or the details that will contribute to your acceptance criteria)

Jot down all the information we can get that we think would be relevant to the story or feature at hand

Mind map all the permutations of data, business rules, user actions, system constraints, etc that can be used form acceptance criteria

Note down any assumptions, unknowns or uncertainty and next steps to resolve them



================================================================================
SLIDE 112
================================================================================

Specify outcomes that result from either user action or  system triggers.

Describe flow of events, actions and reactions, processes, and tasks

Behavioral acceptance criteria can often  follow the form of  When <trigger> then <reaction>

When a call center rep selects a waiting call request on the call center dashboard

Then the call center system will activate the call and connect it to the rep’s work station

As we progress we can start refining our Narrative to cover both behavioral and domain oriented acceptance criteria

Behavioral acceptance criteria

Domain acceptance criteria

will describe a concept according to their structure and composition,

Describe responsibilities, information, relationship with other subjects, along with rules, or constraints pertaining to a particular concept or subject

Can use the form <A Concept> <some interaction or relationship> <another Concept>

A waiting call request include the originating phone number, the wait time of the call, the IVR problem code, and grouped according to business region the caller is calling from

SLIDE 113
================================================================================

When writing Stories structure your narrative in a way that you are constantly shifting across the actors in your story

Think of each criteria as an opportunity to pass the ball from one actor to the next

Often you will start with a user action, then the system will respond in kind, to again be followed by another user action,

You may also be passing the ball between two or more systems that need to integrate with each other

Behavioral Acceptance Criteria describe the interaction between the human and system actors that are part of your story

Tip: If you are writing more than a couple of acceptance criteria for a single actor, consider revising stories to show more interplay between users and the various systems at play

================================================================================

Behavioral acceptance criteria in the form ofWhen <trigger> then <outcome>facilitates our concept of passing the ball across actors.

Sometimes the ball is passed within a single when -> then

Sometimes the ball is passed when we move from one AC to the next

In either case focus on alternating when you pass or  when you run with the ball

A good way to define behavioral acceptance criteria is to add them under each Story in the story map

================================================================================

Stories often get cluttered with information that applies to more than one story, epic, feature, etc

Teams end up re-iterating the same concepts over and over

When concepts cross teams this repetition gets worse and worse…

The understanding of concepts often change over time, sometime because we learn, sometimes because we forget

Different stories can end up contradicting each other, and be inconsistent in the way ideas are expressed

This gets worse as we scale, especially when more than one team is working in the same domain

When everything is described in behavioral acceptance criteria we can suffer from repetition and inconsistency

Domain acceptance criteria describe a concept in terms of its responsibilities, information, relationship with other subjects

This helps us to increase our shared understanding of complex domains

Thinking structurally, write sentences down using the form <A Concept> <some interaction or relationship> <another Concept(s)>

In a way we are passing the ball a bit differently this time, after every behavioral acceptance criteria we can consider injecting more domain-oriented ones

Domain oriented acceptance criteria elaborate and further explain our behavioral ones

When a Customer conducts Chargeable Activity

Then the System will track that Chargeable Activity

When Chargeable Activity exceeds a Chargeable Threshold ….

Then the System will create an Alert and send it to the Customer’s Alert Queue

Go through your behavioral acceptance and identify the major concepts or subjects under discussion

For each concept identified try to describe major responsibilities, information, constraints or relationships with other concept

In general, write out  statements in the very loose form of A < Concept> <some interaction or relationship> <another sub or related Concept(s)>

Think about what concepts will span multiple stories, features, increments etc and move them to a separate place, perhaps linking them to your behavioral AC

Refining Your Story Map during Story Exploration



================================================================================
SLIDE 123
================================================================================

In order to move forward with pace in the face of uncertainty, we are always moving forward with an imperfect and incomplete understanding of what we want to accomplish

This means we will constantly be uncovering information that invalidates, at least in part, our previous understanding of what we want to accomplish

Moving forward with out of date artifacts is an example of a small leak that reduces agility, and can eventually sink the ship

Working effectively with agility means  we are constantly going back and revising our original plans, scope, solution, etc.

Team navigate this reality by keeping their artifacts light weight enough so they can modify them as new ideas emerge

Deeper analysis almost always requires that we refactor our initial, higher level perspectives

Tip: Use previous artifacts as a starting point for more details discussion, not a fixed constraint, and be ready to modify high level pictures based on what you have uncovered in lower level ones

SLIDE 124
================================================================================

Story Exploration is an excellent example of where we often see opportunity to revisit;  Team often refine Stories in their story map to better reflect our increased understanding

Initial Story Map

Story Map with Initial Acceptance Criteria

Story Map Normalize

Stories are split where necessary to ensure they can be developed and tested by a single team in a couple of days

Large enough that they capture a cohesive set of user and system behavior that can be tested by the business

We may add and/or defer some stories to a later increment

Some Stories end up being large, even massive

Some stories only have 1-2 criteria, and appear tiny

We may have orphaned acceptance criteria, we missed a story or two on our initial story map

Our original picture of all the stories we think we need after performing discovery on an Increment



================================================================================
SLIDE 125
================================================================================

Go through the stories in your feature and ask what changes do you need to make in the story map?

Where can stories be split and merged?

Where do we need to add new stories or change the flow of the stories?

Where do we want to defer stories to later increments and/or identify new stories that we can deliver later?

Vertical Story Splitting



================================================================================
SLIDE 127
================================================================================

Top signs that you should split a story:

When a story is too big to complete within a reasonable timeframe (2 weeks is common rule of thumb)

When a story is too complex or complicated, causing a lot of questions from developers

When you want to get quick feedback from your stakeholders

When a story has a lot of dependencies (team and external)

Story splitting allow teams to ensure we can inject feedback into our delivery and development activities

Why bother splitting? I have all the information I need!

Small stories allow the team to fail early, and fail fast

Smaller stories enable the team to learn quickly (both technically and user experience)

Smaller stories pass more quickly through the workflow

Smaller stories have more certainty and clarity

Smaller stories make the team faster!

Story Splitting Pitfalls to watch out for:

Splitting stories horizontally first before trying to split the scope can lead to isolation of other layers and thus increase dependencies and hinder overall pace of development

Splitting stories until they become tasks and to the point that product owner does not have see any value in the “stories” at this level, and we end up with stories that are not testable by anyone other than a developer, and therefore cannot be accepted or demoed



================================================================================
SLIDE 128
================================================================================

Teams can leverage a number of story splitting patterns to keep stories small

Story Splitting Patterns

There are many approaches to splitting stories. We will explore a couple aiming to maintain INVEST principles via Vertical Slicing

Workflow Steps What steps does a user perform and

can I separate or simplify the steps to deliver now vs later?

Business Rules What business rules apply to this story and what can I simplify or separate business rules right now vs later?

Send a cross currency wire to another entity

Send a cross currency wire of < $50K using daily updated daily table

Send a cross currency wire of >=$50K using a live FX rate

First Story

Happy/Unhappy Path What does the happy / unhappy flow look like, can unhappy flows be simplified, separated or are they even necessary now vs later?

log in with correct credentials

Block users with 3 failed login attempts in a row

Request a new password

Log into Bizbank

Splitting on Operations What operations are involved and which of these can we separate out and consider for now vs later?

Manage recurring payments

Add a new recurring payment

update the amount and date of an existing recurring expense

Delete a recurring payment

How Do I Know Where To Stop?

Getting this under 2 weeks is a good rule of thumb, this allows you to deploy and test more frequently

2. How will we test this?

Someone who is not an engineer must be able to test the story’s behaviour (tools such as Postman, Rest Assured may be required)

In other words, try to avoid “stories” that manipulate data and variables solely in memory

How long will the story take to develop?

Look at your Stories, which of these still feel too large?

When in doubt, look at number of acceptance criteria! If the list is long, really consider breaking that story up

Examine these stories and see if one or more splitting patterns apply

Alternatively, look at your acceptance criteria. Are there distinct groups within them? If so, use those boundary lines to create your new story breakdown

Remap stories and re-allocate acceptance criteria as necessary

Validate: Have we gone too far? Is this still testable from an end-user perspective?

Exercise: Revisit your stories being explored and apply vertical splitting patterns at necessary

Horizontal Story Splitting (Defining System Level Stories)



================================================================================
SLIDE 133
================================================================================

Sometime we are heavily challenged to come up with a small increment of team work that is a recognizable increment of user and system behavior

Perhaps the there is a large amount of back-office system to system related processes

Perhaps different portions of the user observable behavior is being developed by separate teams and you have little influence on this team structure (eg back office and front end teams)

Perhaps you have broken your architecture into discrete micro-services that are owned by discrete team and want to separate stories for each separate service

While good story writing keeps us focused on user to system interactions, sometimes we need to deeper

Tip: When the context asks for it, consider going below sea level and define stories and story acceptance criteria for interactions across system / technical components

Captures system behavior that a user can see

Have observable value to the user

Are clearly testable; we will learn something after we deliver it

Can get really large in terms of time and effort, especially for new team and/or legacy technology

Going below Sea Levels can dilute the value and purpose of stories; at a minimum make sure you are always using stories to describe behavior

Not a story!!!!

Avoid if at all possible!!!!

Example: Store An Image

Let’s take an example of a seemingly simple story; at least from a user perspective



================================================================================
SLIDE 136
================================================================================

User Story: Successfully Store an Image Scan

Story Summary

As a Staff user

I want to store a the scan of an image in the cloud

So that it can be accessed from any location

Acceptance Criteria

Successful transmission shows confirmation message “Image Scan Successful”

Scanned image is present in database

User Story: Unsuccessfully Store a Image Image

I want to be notified if my image is not saved

So that I know to save it to the local database

User Stories Only Consider User-Visible Impact

Look at your Stories, which stories require more than a single team to deliver on?

Which Stories are still too big from an implementation perspective?

Split these stories into system stories, and if absolutely necessary technical stories

Rewrite acceptance criteria to reflect the perspective of the system and/or technical component (hint technical team members will be required)

Exercise: Revisit your stories and add system and/or technical stories if (and only if) required

Most common types of non-functional acceptance criteria for front-end development:

Performance (How fast should the page/function respond to the user?)

Security (Is there anything we shouldn’t allow for security purposes?)

Usability is also common, however usually manifests itself in the UI design instead of the Acceptance Criteria (eg. How many clicks does it take to do the task? How many seconds?)

Writing User Stories is one of the core competencies of an Agile Team; but remember:

There are principles to gauge story quality but there are few rules to follow when writing stories

Writing good stories is really hard! Expect the first stories you write to be poor and for quality to improve with practice

Teams will usually struggle at the beginning to break stories small enough that they can be completed in a short amount of time (ie < 2 wks)

It is important to bound the story without predetermining the solution

Writing stories is part art, part science

It takes practice to get good at writing stories

It takes even more practice to get stories right-sized

Business constraints need to be balanced against the technical solution

Here are a few takeaways on User Stories:

SLIDE 149
================================================================================

Spec By Example – In a Nutshell

Spec by Example is A way to express complex system behaviour  (in stories) in a simple, structured way

Spec By Example extends the acceptance criteria teams define by defining scenarios as well as adding real world examples to those scenarios

Spec by Example works because Humans often struggle to interpret complex concepts in the same way;

But humans are very good at deriving concepts by observing them in action

Spec By Example helps Increases team understanding, leading to faster delivery and fewer bugs

The practices helps teams spot requirement holes and edge cases before starting to code

Spec by Example has excellent integration with ATDD/BDD tools, so that examples can be plugged directly into automated tests, so that teams can rely on business rule documentation that automated, and always up to date

Spec by Example

Story Exploration

How Specs fit into Story Development

Story Spec with Examples

Story Specification Scenarios

Story Card

Story Acceptance Criteria

All of the stories in a feature or thin slice are described using semi formal acceptance criteria

Unknowns are explored, solution feasibility, UX (lo-fi minimum) are designed, story sizes are confirmed, etc

Behavior Driven Development

Test Fixture

Code

One story is specified at a time

Acceptance Criteria are converted to multi-step scenarios by adding pre-conditions, alternate and exceptional flows, ordering steps, etc

Scenarios are extended with examples; we add data sets to that contribute to one or more test cases; forming a test suite

Developers or QC write a test fixture, using a BDD tool (eg Cucumber)

Developers write code until the test pass

BA/QC perform a final verification and a quick manual test

Story: Purchase Textbook

Given a student is logged in to the system

And a particular textbook exists

And that textbook is not out of stock

When

The student selects that textbook for purchase

And the student specifies shipping information( shipping method, billing address, shipping address )

And the student confirms his purchase

Then the system send the payment information to the 3rd party

And the system send the Order Details to the bookstore application

And a message is display to the student that the book was successfully purchased and is on its way

And after the second transaction the account has a balance of -$10 and is in overdraft

And the second transaction is successful

successful

Business user can click execute to run the test

rejected

$50

not in overdraft

The system is tested against the requirements

If the test passes then the requirements go green

If the test fails then the requirements go red.

Requirements can be written in the form of a “story” using the language of the business

Other formats can be supported (i.e. use case, process, etc.)

Be Precise and make the specification testable

Focus on business functionality, not design

Avoid UI details

Avoid covering every possible combination (emphasis scenarios based on risk)

Supplement with Exploratory & User Experience Testing to increase  test coverage

Include non-functional scenarios (e.g. performance, load, usability, etc.) as specification by example

The 10 Deadly Sins of Spec By Example

No examples

Incorrect Trigger

Repetition

Using UI elements (not contents) in Given, treating as steps

Irrelevant Givens

Unreadable formatting

Exposing inner workings of the system

Imprecise Language

Doing Specs after Engineering

Overspeccing



================================================================================
SLIDE 160
================================================================================

Sin #1&2: No Examples, Incorrect Trigger

Use licence # to verify AB residence

Given I have the following client record

And the following licence record

When I do a client search for “John Jones”

Then I should get the following result

Given I have searched for a client by first and last name

When a record is found

Then use licence number to verify location of residence

And display province of driver’s licence

Client ID | FName | LName | Licence #

178654 | John | Jones | 35612

Try to avoid simply transposing a standard acceptance criterion into Given When Then, instead show the conditions that cause the behaviour

Licence # | Prov

35612 | AB

Province



================================================================================
SLIDE 161
================================================================================

Sin #3: Repetition

No payload field may be empty

Given I have the following scanned cheque image payloads

When I import the payloads

Then I should get the following results

1. CHECK CHEQUE ID

GIVEN Cheque Image payload has been received by Hermes

WHEN Cheque ID# is NOT populated in the payload

THEN Log payload as a failure

2. CHECK BRANCH ID

WHEN Cheque ID does NOT end with the branch ID

3. CHECK METHOD

WHEN Method is NOT "scan" OR "rescan"

4. CHECK LANGUAGE

WHEN Language is NOT "en" OR "fr"

5. CHECK INTAKE TIMESTAMP

WHEN Intake timestamp does not exist

6. CHECK PROVINCE

WHEN Province is not present

Cheque ID | Method | Language | Timestamp | Province

<blank> | Scan | EN | 11:12:00-03/14/2020 | ON

4269-10 | <blank> | EN | 11:12:00-03/14/2020 | ON

4269-10 | Scan | <blank> | 11:12:00-03/14/2020 | ON

4269-10 | Scan | EN | <blank> | ON

4269-10 | Scan | EN | 11:12:00-03/14/2020 | <blank>

4269-10 | Scan | EN | 11:12:00-03/14/2020 | ON

Result

Fail

Pass

Branch ID must be embedded in Cheque ID

Method must be scan or re-scan

Language must be en or fr

Sin #4: Treating Givens Like A Traditional Manual Test Case

Recurring bill payments expire after period end

Given I log in as a user with correct permissions

And I click on the home screen

And click on the Bill Payment button

And in the payee filter field enter “CRA”

And check the Active Only option

And my recurring payment with the CRA has an end date in the future

When I click the filter button

Then I see CRA listed in my results

Focus your Givens on setting up data, not the UI actions

Given the following recurring bill pay record exists

When I submit the following queries

Then I should get the following results

Txn ID | Acct ID | Payee ID | Period Start | Period End

777888 | 156332 | 46722 | 03/14/2020 | 01/01/2021

Sin #7: Exposing Inner Workings

Your Spec should represent how you will test, not how you will implement

Use licence # to verify AB residence

Given I have the following client record

And the following licence record

When I do a client search for “John Jones”

Then I should get the following result

Client ID | FName | LName | Licence #

178654 | John | Jones | 35612

Licence # | Prov

35612 | AB

Province

Then extract first name from FName field

And extract last name from LName field

Sin #9: Starting Specs After Engineering Is Complete

Most of the benefit of specification by example is in preventing bugs from occurring through clear communication

The 2nd most benefit is using them to form your automated tests

Neither of these things can happen if you start writing them after engineering!

Sin #10: Over Speccing

GIVEN I have signed in successfully

WHEN I navigate to the Bill Payment screen

THEN I see the header bar with working links to all other payment rails

AND the payee table is shown at an offset of 24px from the sidebar…

Specification by Example is a powerful tool for communicating complex logic. However, it does not have to be the only tool in your bag! Use it judiciously.

WHEN I enter aquickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog in the Client Name field

THEN show an error and stop text entry after character 30

Look and feel matches mockup

Hyperlinking to content saves a lot of time, and a picture is worth a thousand words

Client Name field will not accept more than 30 characters (show error matching with other payment rails)

Low return on investment when speccing criteria that has no conditional logic

By selecting a card using direct pay the player and transaction are verified and fulfilled via PaySafe (Third Party Vendor).

Optional Narrative

A Player does…

And then a Player does…

Or they do

And the system may do….

The Player has an option to…

A user does… and the system does… and then a user does…

Tip: As you are mapping out your stories spend time practicing telling the story of what you want the system to do

Exercise : Practice story telling using your story map to help you share your narrative of future user and system behavior

A good analogy is playing a game of Tetris

The rate that work arrives is inconsistent and can fluctuate dramatically

While shapes sometimes repeat, the level of variation in shape, size and color defy up front planning

Opportunities emerge to get a better score in real time

Agile planning is a just in time activity where we allocate differently shaped demand to fit into a relatively fixed set of capacity

With a backlog we can Shuffle work to the appropriate location on the system based on risk, priority, capability, or dependencies.

Work is placed on one more team’s backlogs until a team’s capacity to deliver stories for a particular period of time has been met

As we get closer to delivery start, shape, size, and allocation of work can be adjusted – like playing a game of tetris!

Dev Backlogs can be adjusted in real time as labs progress work through their story flow

As an Initiative is being shaped, we can have a discussion with dev / tech about when and where we can place it on the backlog, respecting teams existing estimates of their throughput

During Discover we can update backlogs to reflect the increments, and features identify and define

We want both Labs and Dev Teams to pay attention to make sure labs aren’t flowing work so fast that they create a large backlog of detailed and highly defined work; we also want to watch for Dev teams never running out of work

Exercise: Place relatively sized work onto one or more team's backlog

Finish relatively sizing your Initiative, Increments, or Features in your story map in terms of effort and complexity; guide the conversation by stack ranking them against other new items and/or previously delivered ones. Once relatively sized, we can infer a story count for each Initiative, Increment, or Feature

Place initiatives, increments, and/or Features into one or more teams backlogs according to priority, risk mitigation, learning and /or value. Try to line up demand and position work so that it lines up across teams so that multiple teams can works simultaneously to deliver on an integrated set of functionality

New

Bonus: Try write out a prediction of how stories will flow across our system of work. Think about the cadences we can use to help us plot movement of stories (eg planning, story testing, integration testing) to ensure we inject sufficient feedback into the system,

The Agile practice Of Relative Sizing is best conducted where size actually matters, Upstream and for larger buckets of Scope

Remember as part of Idea Shaping we want to do just enough story mapping to extrapolate how many epics, feature, and stories make up an increment

100 Stories

10 Stories

New Initiative

Already Delivered Initiative

At any point the work can be assessed by comparing and contrasting it to work previously completed.

As long work is similar from a platform and team perspective, than it is relatively easy to relatively size the new initiative against previously completed one

Incr. 1

Incr. 2

Incr. 3

Incr. 4

During Idea Shaping and Discovery we are continually identifying and refining our Marketable Increments

In either of these stages we can relate size our increments in the initiatives against each other as well as previously delivered increments of value that are similar in platform and team skills

Relative sizing at the initiative and increment level gives us an accelerated and surprisingly accurate estimate of size

What Are The Challenges With Traditional Testing Models?

Communication is hard, especially so across departments

Generally not co-located, use low-effectiveness communication methods

Separate management

Separate goals/incentives

Separate tracking systems

People doing testing and people doing development have an adversarial relationship

Results in both groups creating lots and lots of paper in order to CYA

Further reduces incentive to communicate

Testing is the last stop on the train

Inherently an elastic activity

First thing to be compressed

Pay for the sins and decisions of those that came before

Deploying in big batches make it difficult to find and diagnose bugs

This results in bugs that are sent back to developers with little clue on root cause

Also results in high regression defect count, more code means more likely to go wrong

People doing testing have limited domain expertise

Reliance on matching requirements documents instead of matching intent

Results in high false-positive rate

What Is An Epic?

Classic definition: A large user action that needs to be broken down into smaller, more digestible User Stories

Challenge:

Epic is a special reserved card type in some popular work management systems (eg Jira)

We already have a decomposition framework from Story Mapping (Persona-Goal-Activity)

New definition: An epic in your work management system represents any grouping of User Stories. This can be
