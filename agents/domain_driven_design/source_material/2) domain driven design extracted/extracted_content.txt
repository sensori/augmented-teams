The number one reason for failure of software projects is a failure of people to communicate

Language wall between clients and developers)

Domain Models are a Ubiquitous Language,

tight collaboration from both business and delivery teams

drawn in the language of the business

constrained by technology, using technical structure

One model for the code, the diagrams, and the language people use!

Business terms, concepts, etc, used by solution

Business Logic layer of solution

Business logic layer of solution

Business aspects of all layers of the solution (UI, DB, etc)

Business terms not part of the scope of the solution

Business terms part of the of the solution, that are not explicit in the solution



================================================================================
SLIDE 4
================================================================================

The number one reason for failure of software projects is a failure of peopleto communicate

One layer of the solution is built using the language of the model

For cut dev this is the business logic layer

For package, the interfaces and testing layer are good candidates

Use one set of terms across the solution and problem space

Language permeates stories, test cases, database, service methods, etc

One model for the code, the diagrams, and the language people use!

================================================================================

Two Agile Methods Key to Building A Domain Model

Domain Driven Design

An agile methodology for evolving a software system that closely aligns  to business requirements

A Practice to Maintain a Domain Model

A selective abstraction of knowledge from business domain experts

Responsible for representing business concepts, information about business situations, business state, and business rules

Evolves to represent the constraints of the technical solution as it becomes more well understood

A common, ubiquitous language to express business terms using a vocabulary that both technical and business can use

Class responsibility Card Modelling

An Agile Modelling technique to visually represent whole or part of an application or problem domain

Quickly explore, shape, and discard domain concepts

We will be using CRC to practice Domain Driven Design

================================================================================

Building a domain accelerates story mapping,  acceptance criteria, and Spec by example

There is a steep learning curve, and the initial complexity can / will put people off

It scales! Most of the work happens during the first few stories in an epic, covering additional stories become progressively easier and easier

For developers, it can feel like coding with stickies

Coaching Thoughts



================================================================================
SLIDE 17
================================================================================

Outline a Story Map that captures some aspect of a project you are part of,

Keep it brief focus on the major epics, listing perhaps a few stories

Capture any questions you have regarding the business domain, ie business concepts, state, rules, logic or data

Domain Modelling throughout the agile lifecycle



================================================================================
SLIDE 26
================================================================================

Start by modelling functional behaviour (story map, acceptance criteria, spec by example, etc)

Ask domain related questions

What do you mean by X?

Explain the difference between an X and a Y

Describe all the different types of XWhat happens When X does Y?

What the F&@@!& is an X again?

Rephrase the answer in the domain model format (ah ha! So an X is for/does/behaves like….)

Update your model to capture the insight

Update your stories as necessary

Pause every so often and walk the model

Flesh out your domain model in parallel with story exploration

Refine your story map to a greater level

Add details around some key functions and stories, try to tack each major domain area in part

Refine the domain model to answer domain questions across each story

Exercise: Flesh out your Domain Model



================================================================================
SLIDE 32
================================================================================

Validate the domain model by walking through individual stories, tracing the connections and collaborators in the map to see if there is a missing concept

Can the class take a crack at walking the domain model using this story? Does it reveal any missing pieces in the model?



================================================================================
SLIDE 34
================================================================================

Take a set of stories and walk the model to validate the model is complete

Take note of missing sections and update your model as necessary

Refine the domain model to answer domain questions across each story

Refining your Modelling



================================================================================
SLIDE 39
================================================================================

Avoid many to many relationship create a card to represent the relationship

Avoid dependency magnets break up classes with to many responsibilities into discrete domain concepts

Evolve “generic” responsibilities  into domain specific ones

Use Abstractions Push behavior found in multiple places into a common class; use inheritance to “inject” the common behavior into these subject areas

Meta Layer consider moving the configurable part into a separate set of classes, known as a “meta layer”

Walk the Model whenever getting “lost in the model ground the conversation by walking the model through a scenario

Connect to architecture “Annotate and inject” common functionality through inheritance, and collect common behavior into a set of requirements that influence the choice of technology, patterns and/or APIs

Establish boundaries Where multiple teams / systems connect and overlap, call out mapping and integration mechanism; try to express dependencies in terms of specific domain concepts

There are a lot of traps to avoid when writing a domain models, follow these best practices:

As a Class which of these do we want to explore?



================================================================================

When you have a many to many relationship, that is a STRONG signal that you need to create a card to represent the relationship

Use a deliberate strategy to ensure that models stay consistent within and across different team and system boundaries

Keep elements in a model boundary consistent

Models will fragment when worked on by multiple parties in parallel

Continuous Integration of both concepts and implementation is required to stay in synch

High level of rigour; only required within an individual bounded countext

Synchronize across boundaries according to the nature of the dependency

Establishing clear boundaries for each context in play

Identifying relationships across the different context based on dependencies

Define an integration strategy to govern how different team will resolve and synchronize each cross context dependency
