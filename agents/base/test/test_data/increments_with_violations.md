# Story Map Increments: E-Commerce Platform

**Navigation:** [📋 Story Map](../map/e-commerce-platform-story-map.md)

## Increment Planning Philosophy

**🎯 VERTICAL SLICES - NOT Horizontal Layers**

Each increment should deliver a **thin end-to-end working flow** across multiple features/epics, NOT complete one feature/epic at a time.

## Legend
- 🎯 **Epic** - High-level capability
- 📂 **Sub-Epic** - Sub-capability (when epic has > 9 features)
- ⚙️ **Feature** - Cohesive set of functionality
- 📝 **Story** - Small increment of behavior (3-12d)
