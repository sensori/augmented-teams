LOAD + INJECT TEMPLATE EXPLORATION

Business Outcome: Render Output Action loads render JSON files and template files, then injects them into instructions so that the AI can use templates to generate output artifacts during rendering.

(E) Render Output
    (F) Load Rendered Content
        (S) Bot-Behavior --> Load + Inject Template
            (AC) WHEN render_output action executes for a behavior
            (AC) THEN render_output discovers render folder in 2_content/2_render/ (or *_content/*_render/)
            (AC) AND render_output loads all *.json files from render folder (render JSON files)
            (AC) AND render_output loads instructions.json from render folder if it exists
            (AC) WHEN render_output loads render JSON file
            (AC) THEN render_output reads configuration (name, path, template, output, builder if specified)
            (AC) AND render_output checks if render JSON has template field (and no builder field)
            (AC) AND render_output loads template file specified in template field for non-builder renders
            (AC) WHEN render JSON specifies template file (without builder field)
            (AC) THEN render_output loads template file from 2_render/templates/ folder
            (AC) AND render_output loads template file as text content
            (AC) AND render_output stores template content with render config
            (AC) AND render_output handles missing template files gracefully (skips if not found)
            (AC) WHEN render_output has loaded render JSON files and templates
            (AC) THEN render_output injects render_configs array into merged instructions
            (AC) AND each render_config entry includes config and loaded template content (if template-based, not builder)
            (AC) AND render_output injects render_instructions if instructions.json exists in render folder
            (AC) WHEN AI receives injected instructions with render_configs
            (AC) THEN AI can access render configuration from render_configs array
            (AC) AND AI can access loaded template content for template-based renders
            (AC) AND AI can use templates to generate output artifacts during rendering
            (AC) WHEN render JSON specifies builder field
            (AC) THEN render_output does not inject template for that render config
            (AC) AND render_output executes builder Python file instead (builders are executed, not injected)
            (AC) AND builder execution happens separately from template injection
            (AC) WHEN render_output cannot find render folder
            (AC) THEN render_output reports error (render folder is required for render_output action)
            (AC) AND render_output cannot proceed without render configurations
            (AC) WHEN render JSON file cannot be read
            (AC) THEN render_output skips that render JSON file
            (AC) AND render_output continues loading other *.json files from render folder
            (AC) AND render_output does not fail entire load process
            (AC) WHEN template file cannot be read for template-based render
            (AC) THEN render_output skips that template file
            (AC) AND render_output continues loading other templates
            (AC) AND render_output includes successfully loaded templates with render configs
