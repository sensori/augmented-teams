# 📝 Generate Cursor Awareness Files

**Navigation:** [📋 Story Map](../../story-map.txt) | [⚙️ Feature Overview](../Generate%20Bot%20Server%20And%20Tools.md)

**Epic:** Build Agile Bots
**Feature:** Generate Bot Server And Tools

## Story Description

MCP Generator creates workspace rules file to make AI aware of MCP tool trigger patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavioral Criteria

- **WHEN** MCP Generator runs for a bot
  - **THEN** Generator creates `.cursor/rules/mcp-<bot-name>-awareness.mdc` file with bot-specific name
  - **AND** File includes bot name in filename (e.g., `mcp-story-bot-awareness.mdc`, `mcp-bdd-bot-awareness.mdc`)
  - **AND** File includes trigger word patterns from that specific bot's behaviors
  - **AND** Each bot has separate awareness file for independent management

- **WHEN** workspace rules file is generated
  - **THEN** Rules include bot's goal and description from instructions.json
  - **AND** Critical rule states: "When user is trying to [bot goal], ALWAYS check for and use MCP [bot_name] tools FIRST"
  - **AND** Trigger words are sectioned by behavior (not flat list)
  - **AND** Each behavior section includes: "When user is trying to [behavior description] as indicated by **Trigger words:** [list], Then check for [bot_name]_[behavior]_<action> tool"
  - **AND** Rules include error handling: "If registered tool is broken or returns error, do NOT attempt workaround. Inform user of exact error details and ask if should attempt repair or proceed manually"

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Generator creates bot-specific workspace rules file with trigger patterns sectioned by behavior

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given MCP Server Generator is initialized with bot_name='test_bot' and behaviors=['shape', 'discovery']
When Generator runs generate_awareness_files() method
Then Generator creates file at .cursor/rules/mcp-test-bot-awareness.mdc with bot-specific filename
And Filename includes bot name with hyphens: mcp-<bot_name>-awareness.mdc
And File includes bot name in content header
And File sections trigger words by behavior (not flat list)
And Each behavior section includes: behavior name, trigger words for that behavior, tool pattern
And Shape section includes shape trigger words only
And Discovery section includes discovery trigger words only
And Each bot creates separate awareness file for independent management
```

### Scenario: Rules file includes explicit bot-specific instructions with error handling

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Bot has instructions.json with goal and behavior descriptions
When Generator creates .cursor/rules/mcp-<bot-name>-awareness.mdc file
Then Critical rule states: "When user is trying to [bot goal], ALWAYS check for and use MCP story_bot tools FIRST" with specific bot name
And Each behavior section follows format: "When user is trying to: [behavior description] as indicated by **Trigger words:** [list], Then check for story_bot_shape_<action>"
And Shape section states: "When user is trying to: Create initial story map outline as indicated by **Trigger words:** shape story, create story map, Then check for story_bot_shape_<action>"
And File includes error handling section: "If registered tool is broken or returns error, do NOT attempt workaround"
And Error handling instructs: "Inform user of exact error details and ask if should attempt repair or proceed manually"
```

### Scenario: Rules file maps trigger patterns to tool naming conventions

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given MCP Server Generator creates awareness file
When File is written to .cursor/rules/mcp-tool-awareness.mdc
Then File includes tool pattern format: story_bot_<behavior>_<action>
And File includes example: "explore increment 3" → Check for story_bot_exploration_* tools
And File includes example: "shape new feature" → Check for story_bot_shape_* tools
And Pattern examples exist for all bot types (story, domain, bdd, code_agent)
```

### Scenario: Generator handles file write errors gracefully

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given MCP Server Generator attempts to create awareness files
When .cursor/rules/ directory does not exist
Then Generator creates directory before writing file
And File write succeeds
```

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given .cursor/rules/ directory is write-protected
When Generator attempts to write file
Then Generator raises clear error message indicating permission issue
And Error includes path attempted: .cursor/rules/mcp-tool-awareness.mdc
```

## Generated Artifacts

### Workspace Rules File
**Generated by:** MCP Server Generator
**Location:** `.cursor/rules/mcp-<bot-name>-awareness.mdc`
**Content:**
- Bot-specific trigger word patterns by behavior
- Tool naming conventions
- Error handling instructions

## Notes

Generated file: `.cursor/rules/mcp-tool-awareness.mdc` - trigger patterns for AI awareness
