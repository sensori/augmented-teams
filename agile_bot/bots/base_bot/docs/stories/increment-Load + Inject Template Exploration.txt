LOAD + INJECT TEMPLATE EXPLORATION

Business Outcome: Render Output Action loads render JSON files and template files, then injects them into instructions so that the AI can use templates to generate output artifacts during rendering.

(E) Render Output
    (F) Load Rendered Content
        (S) Bot-Behavior --> Load Render Configurations
            (AC) WHEN render_output action executes for a behavior
            (AC) THEN render_output discovers render folder in 2_content/2_render/ (or *_content/*_render/)
            (AC) AND render_output loads all *.json files from render folder (render JSON files)
            (AC) AND render_output loads instructions.json from render folder if it exists
            (AC) WHEN render_output loads render JSON file
            (AC) THEN render_output reads configuration (name, path, template, output, synchronizer if specified)
            (AC) AND render_output checks if render JSON has synchronizer field
            (AC) WHEN render JSON specifies synchronizer field
            (AC) THEN render_output verifies synchronizer field contains full module path and class name
            (AC) AND render_output verifies synchronizer class exists and can be imported
            (AC) AND render_output verifies synchronizer class has render method
            (AC) WHEN render_output cannot find render folder
            (AC) THEN render_output reports error (render folder is required for render_output action)
            (AC) AND render_output cannot proceed without render configurations
            (AC) WHEN render JSON file cannot be read
            (AC) THEN render_output skips that render JSON file
            (AC) AND render_output continues loading other *.json files from render folder
            (AC) AND render_output does not fail entire load process
            (AC) WHEN synchronizer class cannot be imported or does not have render method
            (AC) THEN render_output reports error for that render config
            (AC) AND render_output continues loading other render configs

        (S) Bot-Behavior --> Inject Template Instructions
            (AC) WHEN render_output has loaded render JSON files
            (AC) AND render JSON file specifies template field (without synchronizer field)
            (AC) THEN render_output loads template file from 2_render/templates/ folder
            (AC) AND render_output loads template file as text content
            (AC) AND render_output stores template content with render config
            (AC) WHEN render_output has loaded template files for template-only renders
            (AC) THEN render_output injects render_configs array into merged instructions
            (AC) AND each template-only render_config entry includes config and loaded template content
            (AC) WHEN template file cannot be read for template-only render
            (AC) THEN render_output skips that template file
            (AC) AND render_output continues loading other templates
            (AC) AND render_output includes successfully loaded templates with render configs

        (S) Bot-Behavior --> Inject Synchronizer Instructions
            (AC) WHEN render_output has loaded render JSON files with synchronizer fields
            (AC) AND synchronizer classes have been verified to exist and have render methods
            (AC) THEN render_output includes synchronizer class path in render_configs
            (AC) AND render_output includes renderer_command in config if specified (for render method variant)
            (AC) AND render_output includes instructions to instantiate synchronizer class and call render method
            (AC) WHEN render_output merges instructions for synchronizer-based renders
            (AC) THEN render_output injects render_configs array into merged instructions
            (AC) AND each synchronizer-based render_config entry includes config and synchronizer class path
            (AC) AND base_instructions contain instruction to instantiate synchronizer class
            (AC) AND base_instructions contain instruction to call render method on synchronizer instance
            (AC) AND base_instructions specify render method call with input and output paths
