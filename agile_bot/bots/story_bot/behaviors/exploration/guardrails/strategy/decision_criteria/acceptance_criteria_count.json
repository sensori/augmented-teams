  "options": [
    "Stop when criteria capture a full back-and-forth (user-system-user). Ensures atomic and testable slices.",
    "Stop when each user goal or intent is covered. Emphasizes outcome-focused criteria.",
    "Ensure each criteria can be validated independently. Supports automated testability.",
    "Keep criteria grouped by domain rule or concept. Useful for business-heavy stories.",
    "Constrained to a certain reasonable number of acceptance criteria (e.g., under 9). Split story if exceeds threshold.",
    "Split story when acceptance criteria indicate multiple distinct user goals or system capabilities",
    "Merge stories when acceptance criteria are too granular and represent sub-tasks rather than user value"
