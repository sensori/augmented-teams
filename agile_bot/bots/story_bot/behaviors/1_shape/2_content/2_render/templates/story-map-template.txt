Instructions:
- Use (E) for Epics and Sub-Epics
- Use (S) for Stories
- Use (AC) for Acceptance Criteria
- "and" is the default connector - do NOT show it in output (only stored in JSON)
- Use "or" connector for alternative items (shown explicitly)
- Use "opt" connector for optional items (shown explicitly)
- Show actors with "--> " before story names (e.g., "Human --> Story Name")
- Use hierarchical indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- First item in a sequence has no connector
- Stories can have nested sub-epics
- Stories can have nested stories
- Acceptance criteria are nested under stories
- Use active behavioral language (verb-noun format)
- Epic/Sub-Epic names: Verb-Noun format (actor NOT in name)
- Story names: Actor-Verb-Noun format (actor in story with "-->")
- Epics and Sub-Epics do NOT have connectors (only stories and AC items have connectors)
