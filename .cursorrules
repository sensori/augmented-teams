# Cursor Rules for Augmented Teams Project

## !!! CRITICAL: COMMAND EXECUTION SPEED !!!
**COMMAND TYPE DISTINCTION - EXECUTE BASED ON TYPE**

@cmd-exec-remind - Review these critical command execution rules

### QUICK COMMANDS (Interrupt after 2-3 seconds):
- Directory changes (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls`)
- File operations (`mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`)
- Simple checks (`netstat`, `ps`, `find`)
- Quick status checks
- **DO NOT WAIT** - these hang forever if you wait
- **ALWAYS SAY "CUTTING OFF COMMAND"** when interrupting

### LONG COMMANDS (Let complete naturally):
- Python scripts (`python script.py`)
- Tests (`python test-service.py`)
- Build processes
- Service startups
- **WAIT FOR COMPLETION** - these need to finish to show results

### GENERAL RULES:
- Run commands in parallel batches using multiple tool calls
- Use background processes for long-running services
- Use PowerShell syntax correctly (`;` not `&&`)
- Execute next command immediately without waiting for response
- Batch operations instead of sequential one-by-one execution
- This is a recurring issue that drives users crazy - FIX IT NOW

## Domain-Oriented Design Principles

@domain-design-remind - Review these domain-oriented design principles

### Feature Localization
- **Keep everything local to the feature** - All files, classes, functions, and configurations for a specific domain should be in their feature folder
- **Domain boundaries** - Each feature (`src/features/`) and integration (`src/integration/`) is a self-contained domain
- **5-7 file rule** - Each feature should contain 5-7 core files that cover the complete topic:
  - README.md (overview)
  - Main configuration file
  - Primary functionality script
  - Automation/workflow file
  - Architecture documentation
  - Deployment guide
  - Setup instructions

### Class and Function Organization
- **Domain-specific classes** - All classes stay within their feature domain
- **Feature-specific functions** - No cross-feature dependencies unless explicitly needed
- **Local utilities** - Helper functions belong to the feature that uses them
- **Clear interfaces** - If other features need functionality, expose through clean APIs

### Configuration Management
- **Feature configs** - All feature-specific configuration in the feature folder
- **No global configs** - Avoid putting feature-specific configs in root `config/`
- **Self-contained** - Each feature should work independently with its own config
