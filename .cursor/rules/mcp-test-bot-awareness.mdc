# MCP Tool Awareness

## Bot: test_bot

## Priority: Check MCP Tools First

**CRITICAL RULE:** When user mentions workflow operations with trigger words, ALWAYS check for and use MCP test_bot tools FIRST before falling back to manual file operations.

## Behaviors and Trigger Words



## Error Handling

**CRITICAL:** If a registered tool is broken or returns an error:

1. **DO NOT automatically attempt a workaround**
2. **Inform user of the exact error details** (include full error message, tool name, parameters used)
3. **Ask user:** "The tool returned an error. Should I attempt to repair the tool, or proceed manually?"
4. **Wait for user decision** before taking any action

## Workflow Pattern

When you recognize a trigger word:

1. **Check if MCP tools are available** (ask mode vs agent mode)
2. **If in ask mode:** Inform user to switch to agent mode for MCP tool access
3. **If in agent mode:** Look for matching MCP tool and invoke it
4. **If tool returns error:** Follow error handling above (do NOT workaround)
5. **If no matching tool found:** Fall back to manual operations with explanation

## Example Usage

**User says:** "trigger word"

**AI should:**
1. Recognize trigger word from behavior section above
2. Check: Am I in agent mode?
3. Check: Is `test_bot_shape_clarify` available?
4. If yes → Invoke the tool
5. If no → Explain and ask how to proceed

**DO NOT** immediately start reading files manually without checking for tools first.
