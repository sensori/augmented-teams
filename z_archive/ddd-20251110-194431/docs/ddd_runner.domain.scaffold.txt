DDD Runner Domain Scaffold

DDDCommand
  Base command for DDD operations
  Loads DDD rule file
  Provides common DDD functionality
  
  should load ddd-rule.mdc file
  should provide access to rule principles
  should extend Command base class

DDDStructureCommand
  Extracts domain structure from code/text/diagrams
  Generates hierarchical domain maps
  Applies DDD principles for domain analysis
  
  Generating Domain Structure
    should extract domain concepts from source file
    should apply outcome verbs principle
    should integrate system support under domain concepts
    should order concepts by user mental model
    should organize domain-first before infrastructure
    should focus on functional accomplishment
    should maximize integration of related concepts
    should use nouns for concepts and verbs for behaviors
    should assign behaviors to performing concepts
    should avoid noun redundancy in domain names
    should organize by domain concepts not file structure
    should generate hierarchical text output
    should save to domain-map.txt file
  
  Validating Domain Structure
    should validate against ten DDD principles
    should detect communication verbs violations
    should detect separated system support violations
    should detect code structure ordering violations
    should detect system-first organization violations
    should detect technical framing violations
    should detect artificial separation violations
    should detect verb-based concept names violations
    should detect wrong behavior assignment violations
    should detect noun redundancy violations
    should detect file structure organization violations
    should return validation report with violations

DDDInteractionCommand
  Documents domain concept interactions
  Generates scenario-based business flows
  Maintains domain abstraction level
  
  Generating Domain Interactions
    should discover domain map file as input
    should extract domain concepts from map
    should analyze source code for interactions
    should maintain domain abstraction level
    should generate scenario-based flows
    should document transformations
    should document lookups
    should document business rules
    should show cross-domain reuse
    should save to domain-interactions.txt file
  
  Validating Domain Interactions
    should validate against interaction principles
    should detect implementation details leaking
    should detect missing scenario structure
    should detect code transformations instead of business
    should detect database queries instead of lookups
    should detect code conditionals instead of rules
    should detect code reuse instead of domain reuse
    should return validation report with violations
