Working on this reminded me how perfectly the Agile mindset fits AI. You try something, it fails, you fix it, and you learn. The same principles that made Agile great for engineering — localizing knowledge, working iteratively, and tailoring solutions — are essential here. AI is messy and unpredictable, but structure and guardrails make it powerful.

When deploying contextualized AI for clients, these go from nice-to-have to critical:

Test first and test often

Work in small, specific batches

Modularize everything so it’s decoupled and decentralized

Iterate quickly from concept to user impact
